Film Dev Timer (FDT)

FDT is an open source Java based timer application used to aid the development of photographic film.

Individual stages that can be timed:
* Pre wash
* Developer
* Stop bath
* Fixer
* Hypo clearing
* Final wash
* Wetting agent

Film times can be manually set using data on the film or developer packaging or they can be set using the built in database which consists of many film and developer combos.

The database consists of a CSV file which can easily be modified to add your own custom times.

Agitation times can be altered to suite your developing style and an audible beep is emitted to indicate agitation time should you not be watching the timer throughout development. An audible alarm sounds at the end of each development stage to indicate a chemistry change is required.
